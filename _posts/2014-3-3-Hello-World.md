title: Best Beaches in Florida CLI GEM!
---

This project was an assignment from the on-line course Learn.co created by the Flatiron School in New York City. The assignment was to build and publish a command line interface (CLI) Ruuby Gem that scrapes data from a website and allows the user to interact with the objects created from the scraped data through a CLI. There were two parts that were difficult for me. The assignment required a few extra's that the previous assignmnets had not included. These were this blog that youu are reading here, and a screen capture of how the CLI  works. Both of these extra's I had never done. So, we were left to our own research to finding out how to complete these. The first place I turned was to 'Ask A Question', which allows your question to be answered by other students and teaching assistants at the school. A very nice student directed me to a website called
Build a Blog with Jekyll and Github Pages (https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/)
