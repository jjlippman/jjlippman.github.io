title: Best Beaches in Florida CLI GEM!
---

This project was an assignment from the on-line course Learn.co created by the **Flatiron School in New York City**. The assignment was to build and publish a command line interface (CLI) Ruby Gem that scrapes data from a website and allows the user to interact with the objects created from the scraped data through a CLI. There were two parts that were difficult for me. The assignment required a few extra's that the previous assignmnets had not included. These were this blog that youu are reading here, and a screen capture of how the CLI  works. Both of these extra's I had never done. So, we were left to our own research to finding out how to complete these. The first place I turned was to 'Ask A Question', which allows your question to be answered by other students and teaching assistants at the school. A very nice student directed me to a website called
Build a Blog with Jekyll and Github Pages (https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) which proved to be a very easy solution for someone who had never published a blog before. The other 'extra' which i had to learn was how to make a screen capture demonstration of how the program worked. Again, the coummunity at Learn.co had the answer.
Quicktime proved to be very simple, and the demonstration was very easy to produce.
###Now on to the program.
